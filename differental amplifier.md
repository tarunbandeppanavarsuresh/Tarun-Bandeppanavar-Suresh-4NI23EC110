# Lab3
# Aim
  Design and analyze the mos differential amplifier circuit for the following specification.
# Components Required
  NMOS,Resistor,voltage source,current source
# Theory
  A differential amplifier rejects common-mode signals by design, leveraging the fact that it amplifies only the difference between the voltages at the two inputs (non-inverting and inverting), while it rejects any signals that are common to both inputs. This ability to reject common-mode signals is due to its common-mode rejection mechanism. 
# Question
  Design and analyse the differential amplifier for the following specification Vdd = 1.8v P 
# Circuit 1(Resistor)
